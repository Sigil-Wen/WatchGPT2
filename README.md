# Apple Watch Running GPT2 Locally
GPT2 (distil) running locally on the Apple Watch Ultra 2 with Swift CoreML Transformers.

# Todo:
- Figure out why the app crashes after certain # of tokens are generated - running out of memory? The GPT2 Model is nearly 500 mb. I believe the Apple Watch Ultra has 1 GB of RAM

# Resources:
